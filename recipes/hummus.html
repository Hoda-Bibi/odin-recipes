    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>I grew up on a diet halfway made up of hummus. It's one of my favourite foods, and I cannot emphasise how much I love hummus. This is all I can say.</p>
    <p>Serve with either vegetables (carrots, celery, bell pepper), bread, or in a sandwich. </p>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>15 oz can of chickpeas</li>
        <li>3 tbsp lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 tbsp tahini</li>
        <li>2 small cloves garlic</li>
        <li>0.75 tsp salt</li>
        <li>3 ice cubes</li>
        <li>Olive oil, to serve</li>
        <li>Paprika, to serve</li>
        <li>Pita, vegetables, or lebanese bread, to serve</li>

    </ul>
    
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Optionally, peel the chickpeas within a bowl of water. The skins should float to the surface to be removed easily.</li>
        <li>Drain and dry the chickpeas thoroughly, then transfer to a food processor and pulse into a fine texture.</li>
        <li>Add the lemon juice, tahini, garlic, salt, and ice cubes. Blend until completely smooth, or to your desired texture. Adjust as needed with additional salt and lemon.</li>
        <li>Serve in a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil, sprinkle of paprika, and vegetables or bread on the side.</li>
    </ol>
