    <h3 class="cookies">Description</h3>
    <p>This is the best cookie recipe I've ever made. I've been asked by friends for years to make these whenever possible, and complimented for this recipe many times.</p>
    <p>Every ingredient is important, and should be kept the same quantity. Baking is a science - experiment at your own risk! Having said that, the chocolate can be added onto or swapped out for any mix-ins. Pretzels, marshmallows, cranberries, and more are a great choice! Plan this recipe ahead, as it needs to be refrigerated overnight. The cookies should be taken out slightly before fully cooked - once the edges have begun browning, the cookies can be taken out and will cook fully outside the oven.</p>
