This is a project I'm working on while completing The Odin Project's basic HTML lessons. 
Feel free to offer criticism whenever you find it necessary, I am in fact not a professional.
This is a part of two different instructions from TOP, one is to make a simple website using html, and the second is to make it look more interesting using CSS. For a vague reflection, I found the CSS section more difficult, as I didn't know *what* to add. I can combat this problem in the future by looking for inspiration online, or brainstorming before starting my next project.
