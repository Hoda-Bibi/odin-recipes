# odin-recipes
This is a project I'm working on while completing The Odin Project's basic HTML lessons. 
Feel free to offer criticism whenever you find it necessary, I am in fact not a professional.
This project is to make a recipe website, which I assume I will later improve while learning CSS. I don't know anything about CSS.
